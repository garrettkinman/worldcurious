# Worldcurious

This is a software project meant for hardcore worldbuilding nerds.

Want to plot out the supply chains of fictional economies?

Want to develop plot ideas right out of your worldbuilding?

If so, you're in the right place.

# What this does

At its core, this program is meant to guide and prompt you with questions about your world. Based on your answers, it will construct a model of the world and ask further questions to inspire more in-depth and more compelling worldbuilding.

For example, if it asks you what industry exists in a town, and you put "textiles", it'll then ask you where the raw materials come from (e.g., livestock, crops, trade, etc.), and where the outputs go (e.g., as input to another industry, traded along a trade route, etc.). Then, it might ask you what happens if the inputs stop coming in, or the people buying it stop buying. This is where it will hopefully inspire deeper worldbuilding or plotlines.

# How to run

# Why I'm building this

I saw a post about the project [Ikarus](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1039110/Ikarus/) on [r/worldbuilding](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/), downloaded it, and starting plotting out the worldbuilding for my world. I loved the very open approach it took, and I realized how I could probably just create my own class structure and be able to do extra fancy stuff like simulate supply chains and prompt compelling storytelling. Thus, this project was born.

Plus, I was looking for a good excuse to get good at Rust and WebAssembly.

# Proposed features

## Current goals

*  Complete class diagram to model the following:
   *  Economies
   *  Societies
   *  Governments
   *  Militaries
   *  Character relationships
   *  And more...
*  Appropriate object constraints in the model
*  Browser-based GUI
*  Search tool to search for any object in the model
*  Save to world to file

## Maybe later
