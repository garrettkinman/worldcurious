This is a software project meant for hardcore worldbuilding nerds.

Want to plot out the supply chains of fictional economies?

If so, you're in the right place.

# Why I'm Building This

I saw a post about the project [Ikarus](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1039110/Ikarus/) on [r/worldbuilding](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/), downloaded it, and starting plotting out the worldbuilding for my world. I loved the very open approach it took, and I realized how I could probably just create my own class structure and be able to do extra fancy stuff like simulate and visualize supply chains. Thus, this project was born.

Also, feedback is always very much appreciated.

# Proposed Features
*  Complete class diagram to model the following:
   *  Economies
   *  Societies
   *  Governments
   *  Militaries
   *  Character relationships
   *  And more...
*  Appropriate object constraints in the model
*  GUI following model-view-controller pattern to interact with the model
*  Global hashmap for every object within the model (for search functionality)
*  Save to file
*  Visualizations of supply chains (and maybe other parts of model)
*  Cross-referenced wiki
*  Some way for model to change with time? State machines?
